Write up for the following cases:
Date Range: Sept 1-15, 2017
Threshold: 25
Cases: p85c50, p85c60, p90c60, p90c60lines

Key Values on cases (in order of cases, for all plumes processed):
Number of Plumes: 22, 19, 14, 19
Number of Valid Pairs: 71, 71 ,50, 38
Correlation Coefficient: -0.43672301707990985, -0.43672301707990985, -0.60737306342113029, -0.52646302924341892

Comment: Correlation coefficient appears to improve for plumes of higher FRP
Note: The total number of points plotted varies quite a bit between cases
Note: The number of Valid Pairs for the p85 case is the same, though total number of plumes decreased - not a big loss going from c50 to c60

Comment: Plume heights correspond more closely to 1:1 line at MINX Plume Height > ~2000m
Note: Most deviation from 1:1 line is in the case of extremely low MINX Plume Height whereas the Model Plume shows larger values (varying, but almost always greater than the MINX heights) - may be that MINX results are wrong (check values closer to origin)
Note: More scattering of points is visible in the p85 cases - may be more Valid Points (more to plot)
Note: More red band plumes were plotted - likely due to greater number of red band plumes overall, but may indicate that the blue band plume results may be off (p90 cases show no blue band plumes after 'cleaning')

Comment: Model Plume Heights were largely determined by AF values of range [25-100]
Note: A secondary peak of AF values is found in range [250-425]
Note: the p90c60lines case shows a larger spread of AF values used for Model Height determination

Comment: Plume FRP ranges from [0-3000] for the cases p85c50, p85c60, p90c60, where FRP = Total Fire Power (MWatts)
Note: Range of [50-2500] for case p90c60 - may be due to more strict choice of hotspots
Note: Range of [0-0.1] for case p90c60lines - may be due to digitization using lines

General Results:
- For model height values returned, more of these values are found near the tail end of the corresponding MINX plume
- When the model heights follow a similar shape of the MINX plume, these values are often much lower or higher MINX plume
- The model has a tendency to be very flat
- p85 seems to produce a good number of pairs, may stick with this value for future test cases

Possible Changes to test (strictly MINX and Model plume comparisons):
- more dramatic differences in p/c levels
- eliminate height values for extremely close distances (<2km from origin), note that plots may stay the same
- larger radius, check whether or not the model location is actually correct, lots of values are being dropped so can't confirm plume shape is correct
NOTE: sometimes not getting plotted values for MINX plume heights, should probably take a better look at these as well
NOTE: the overlap in the p85 cases may be due in part of copying over all of the p85c60 plumes into p85c50, wiping out some potentially unique plumes processed earlier in p85c50
