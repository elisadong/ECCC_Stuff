Getting preMINX to run:
	1. Get the latest version of anaconda, this should give you a folder called .conda
	. ssmuse-sh -x hpco/exp/mib002/anaconda2/anaconda2-5.0.1-hpcobeta2

	2. Softlink .conda/pkgs and .conda/env to somewhere with a lot of space

	3. Create a new environment with desired modules (or install these after)
conda create -n py2-1.0 python=2.7 anaconda <module 2>  <module 3> <etc>

	4. Enter the new environment
source activate py2-1.0

	5. Use anaconda to install some packages if you don't have them:
conda install matplotlib==1.3.1
conda install numpy==1.14.0
conda install netCDF4==1.3.1
conda install scipy==1.0.0
conda install requests==2.18.4
conda install -c anaconda basemap

To check whether or not you have the packages, try:
conda list

	6. Try pip install for the other packages (anaconda doesn't have all of them):
pip install python-hdf4==0.9
pip install simplekml==1.3.0
pip install pyorbital==1.1.1

	7. If that doesn't work, you have to copy over the appropriate folders from:
/fs/site2/dev/eccc/aq/r1/eld001/condaPkgs/ to wherever the .conda/pkgs softlinked folder is
The folders you want are (not sure if dist-info is necessary, but just in case…):
python_hdf4-0.9.dist-info
pyhdf
pyorbital-v1.2.0.dist-info
pyorbital
simplekml-1.3.0.dist-info
simplekml

	8. Update the .profile.d/interactive/post file to point to the appropriate package location and MINX folders by adding the lines:

	export PATH=$PATH:/fs/home/fs1/eccc/aq/arqi/mas001/computer_programs/python/MINX
	export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/fs/home/fs1/eccc/aq/arqi/mas001/computer_programs/python/MINX
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:<location of .conda/pkgs>

	9. Restart and try running this in a test folder (will create a bunch of files and folders):
preMINX -d 2017.09.04 -L -121.6406 -97.3125 48.2343 60.75  -u elisadong -p elisaPass1 --grandir ./granules

	10. Add in gdal for post processing stuff
conda install gdal

PYTHON PATH SETUP:

add the following lines to your profile:

# MINX software
export PATH=$PATH:/space/hall2/sitestore/eccc/aq/r1/nod001/MINX/MINX4

# Plume Height computer programs requirements
export PATH=$PATH:/fs/home/fs1/eccc/aq/arqi/mas001/computer_programs/python/MINX
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/fs/home/fs1/eccc/aq/arqi/mas001/computer_programs/python/MINX

export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/fs/site2/dev/eccc/aq/r1/eld001/condaPkgs #REPLACE THIS LINE WITH WHERE YOU HAVE SAVED YOUR CONDA PACKAGES
export PPP_CONFIG_DIR=/fs/home/fs1/eccc/aq/arqi/mas001/computer_programs/python/MINX/data

# Must include this to import MINX modules directly, else must import MINX.postMINX
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/fs/home/fs1/eccc/aq/arqi/mas001/computer_programs/python/MINX/MINX

# Include path to own scripts
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/fs/home/fs1/eccc/aq/arqi/eld001/scripts
